The owner of a bookstore chain that has thrived over time has decided to retire and leave the company to his son. 
Because he has always done well, the previous owner never considered the option of doing business on the Internet. 
But now that his son is in charge, he has asked us if we can help him access more customers through a web application. 
He knows the world of books very well and uses the Internet as a regular user, but he has no computer knowledge and hopes that our experience and knowledge will be used to develop a functional and intuitive website.

The service consists of a website where users can search for a book they want to find, but they should also be able to view random books in general, as well as books filtered by author or category. When they find a book they like, they should be able to select it to see more details, such as a description, title, author, and price. Once the user has decided that they like a book, they should be allowed to buy it.

On the other hand, the service must also be able to allow new books to go on sale, withdraw them, or modify the information regarding a book (in case there was an error when entering the data for the first time).

Create only the main screen of the application. It's mostly about applying the knowledge you've gained from the materials. 
For now, you can only build a static page without user interaction. A
s a tip donâ€™t try to make it perfect, nor do you need to be responsive. 
For now, try to recreate as best you can the scheme you designed.
