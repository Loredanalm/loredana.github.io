As you know, Bootstrap is the most used framework to create responsive pages. The goal of this section will be to convert previously created pages using Bootstrap 4.

Field validation with Javascript

The aim of this section will be to validate the forms on your website with javascript.

- Validate the search form:

● Conditions: The word entered must be mandatory and contain more than 3 characters.

- Validate the login form (must have an email field and a password field):

● Conditions: Email and password fields must be required. The email must follow the standard email format

- Validate the registration form (at least you must have an email field, password, repeat password and a provincial drop-down).

● We leave the validation conditions in your hands.
